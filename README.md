# Title (clear, not clickbait)

## Motivation
Why this matters (real problem, not theory)

## Core Idea
High-level explanation (no heavy math yet)

## Mathematical Model
$$ x_{k+1} = Ax_k + Bu_k $$

## Key Insight
What is *non-obvious* or useful here?

## Simulation / Results
(plots, gifs, tables)

## Practical Implications
How this helps in real systems
